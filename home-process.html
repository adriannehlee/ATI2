<h3>
	How long does the Department have to respond?
		</h3>

<p>
	Both Acts allow for a legal response time of 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of an official request. However, this period may be extended for limited and specific reasons identified in the Acts. For instance, extensions may be taken if:
<ul>
	<li>the request is for a large number of records or necessitates a search through a large number of records and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the government institution;</li>
<li>consultations are necessary to comply with the request that cannot be completed within the original time limit; or</li>
<li>additional time is necessary for translation purposes or for converting personal information into an alternative format.</li>
		</ul>
