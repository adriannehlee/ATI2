<h2>Do I need an account?</h2>
    
<p>There are 2 ways to make a secure Access to Information or Personal information request:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>As a guest</b>: If you are not a frequent user of this service, this option enables you to proceed without creating an account.<br><br>You will be asked to provide and validate an email address. Once you submit your email address, an email will be sent to you with a link that will bring you back to this site to continue your request submission. This step ensures that we can reach you about your request.<br><br></li>
<li><b>As an account holder</b>: If you are a frequent user of this service, you may prefer to create a login.<br><br>This option will require you to validate your email address only during the registration process (instead of re-validating it each time, as a guest would be required to do). The account consists only of your email and a password that you choose. No other personal information is requested to create the account.<br><br></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that additional contact information will be requested as part of the submission process. This information is only requested to assist the institution in fulfilling your request, and does not become part of your account in the Access to Information and Personal Information Online system.
